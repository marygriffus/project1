Project 1 - Concentration:

As a user, I want to ...

      < - Bronze level - >

... flip a card over to see what is on the other side

... flip a second card to see if I have a match

... see the two cards for a small amount of time so that I have a chance to remember them

... have an unsuccessful match flip back over so I can search for a successful one

... have a successful match stay flipped so I can concentrate on remaining cards

... have the game end when I have found all matches

      < - Silver level - >

... see the instructions if I don't know how to play

... have my games timed so that the game is more exciting

... choose between different themes of deck so that I can change it up if I don't like one

      < - Gold level - >

... save my times/display my best time so that I can compete against myself or friends

... save a card in a slot so that I can make matches more easily if I feel like it is too difficult

... change the settings so that the game is more difficult

... change the game mode so that I can only get as many matches as I can make within a set amount of time to make the game more exciting

... change the number of cards displayed to make the game harder or easier
